## Workshop Goals
After this workshop you will know how to:
* Use `#[ink::contract]` and `#[ink(message)]` macros
* Compile an ink! smart contract 
* Deploy your contract using the `*.contract` files

## Prerequisites
* Complete the [Setup Guide](https://github.com/paritytech/ink-workshop/blob/main/workshop/1_SETUP.md).
* Clone the repo:
```sh
git clone --depth 1 git@github.com:paritytech/ink-workshop.git
```

## The Game
Squink Splash is a game where participants paint as many squares on a game board as possible within a fixed amount of blocks on the blockchain. Those who paint the most squares and use the least amount of gas will earn the most points. Squares are painted by submitting a transaction to a master Game instance, which will then call your code inside the Player contract that you will compile and deploy in the following steps.

## Updating the Player Contract

You are going to use a pre-existing smart contract called "Player" located here:
```sh
./beginners-workshop/basic-player/lib.rs
```

1. Update the function `your_turn` so that it returns your two favorite numbers between 0-9 for both the x and the y dimensions. e.g. `Field { x: 3, y: 7 }`
2. Compile the contract:
```sh
# Inside of ./beginners-workshop/basic-player/
cargo contract build --release
```
This will generate the file `./target/ink/player.contract`, which contains a WASM blob (deployed to the blockchain) and Metadata (used for client applications) that you will use to deploy next.

## Deploying the Player contract

NOTE: The person leading the workshop will first deploy a master Game contract and will give you the contract instance's address. You will need to pass this value to the constructor of your Player.

1. Visit [contracts-ui.substrate.io](https://contracts-ui.substrate.io/add-contract):
2. Choose `Upload New Contract Code`, then `Upload Contract Bundle`.
3. Navigate to your newly compiled `player.contract` file and then click `Next`.

Voil√†. You should see a contructor function with a `game` parameter. 

4. Click on the dropdown, paste in the address of the deployed Game contract that the moderator shared with you, and hit `<ENTER>`.
5. Click `Next`, then `Upload and Instantiate`.
6. Your browser extension should pop up requesting your signature. Sign it!

If your contract was successfully deployer you should see the address on the top of the page. You will need this in a second.

## Joining the Game

1. Visit [splash.use.ink](https://splash.use.ink) and paste in the Game address that your moderator shared with you.
2. Click on `JOIN GAME` in the bottom right
3. Add your player's name ([emojis are allowed ü¶ë](https://getemoji.com/)), and add the address of your deployed Player contract.
4. Click `REGISTER` and sign the transaction

## Game Start and Player Turns!

After all players have registered your moderator will start the game via a blockchain transaction. Once the game has started you will be able to submit your turn. 

1. Click `Submit Turn` on the bottom right 
2. Sign the transaction.
